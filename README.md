Hello, I've chosen the 2nd task

How to run tests:
1. Clone current repository 
2. Open this directory and go into the folder with pom.xml file
3. Execute in terminal or cmd tool command - "mvn test -Pchrome" or "mvn test -Pfirefox" to run tests

There are the following problems which weren't fixed by lack of time or can be done better:

1) Найти все одинаковые для обоих телефонов параметры - it wasn't done
2) There is problem with running tests on FireFox browser
3) There is ad popup in the right bottom corner. It is displayed sometimes and it overlaps "Купити" button,
so the best solution is to run Chrome with adblock extension, but I fix this problem by simple closing it
4) DB is hosted on my Home PC
